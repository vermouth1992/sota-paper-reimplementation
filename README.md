# Reimplementation of State-of-the-art Papers on a Desktop with one GPU
## Motivation
This repo contains reimplementation of a list of SOTA papers.
For each algorithm, we implement:
- The main algorithm
- Main results from the paper
- Ablation study results
- Results that can't be reproduced with insights and explanation

## Code Structure
This repo is not meant to build a library. 
Thus, we keep one algorithm per folder with specific environment requirements.txt that generated the reproduced results. 
This causes rewriting codes with similar functionalities many times in various algorithms.
