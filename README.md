# Reimplementation of State-of-the-art Papers on a Desktop with one GPU
## Motivation

This repo contains reimplementation of a list of SOTA papers.
For each algorithm, we implement:

- The main algorithm
- Summary of the paper

If the computational resource is enough, we would also include

- Main results from the paper
- Ablation study results
- Results that can't be reproduced with insights and explanation
  If the computational resource is insufficient, we would

## Code Structure

This repo is not meant to build a library.
Thus, we keep one algorithm per folder with specific environment requirements.txt that generated the reproduced results.
This causes rewriting codes with similar functionalities many times in various algorithms.

## Reimplemented Algorithms

### Image Classification

- ResNet: [Code](), [Paper Summary](), [Cifar10 Results]()

### Reinforcement Learning

- Distributed Prioritized Experience Replay:
